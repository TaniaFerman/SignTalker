### Meeting 4

  __Date:__ September 20, 2016
  __Beginning time:__ 13:30
  __Ending time:__ 15:00
  __Location:__ Computer Vision Research Lab - EOW 353

#### Purpose: Change project idea
#### Description: Due to the feedback that we received, we decided to change our project idea

1. Idea Proposal:
  <br>
  We are proposing a mobile app that will act as a tool to enable those in the deaf community to have a more dynamic communications with non-deaf people.  For those who are able to lip-read but are not capable of speech are limited to using text-to-speech functions.  This is a disengagement as the listener must wait for the finish typing out a sentence(s) on a mobile keyboard.  Our proposed solution is to use the camera on an Android device and existing gesture recognition and text-to-speech technologies to automatically translate the American Sign Language (ASL) alphabet into speech.

  The user would place their hand a comfortable distance above the phone (for example, while the device lays flat on a table) with the app open.  Prior to that, they will have performed a set of calibration tests to customize the performance of the app to their hand.  They will fingerspell like normal and tap the phone screen once they finish a word.  The interpreted word is then fed through the Google Text Prediction API to remove false-positive results and feed to a text-to-speech API.  Thus, allowing the user to to communicate verbally in near real-time.

2. Target Audience:
  <br>
    - __Name:__ Bob
    - __Type:__ Co-Editor-in-Chief of y.a.m. magazine 
    - __Role:__ User
    - __Narrative:__ Bob is a deaf person who works in a local magazine in Victoria, BC. Bob can lip-read and use sign language. He loves his work, but finds very challenging to communicate with people who don't understand sign language. He tried different technologies such as text to speech, but he found those technologies are inefficient for having a dynamic conversation. Therefore, He would like to find a web tool that enables him to solve his communications issues.

3. Existing Solutions:
  <br>   
  - Translator from words or sentence to ASL can be found easily, they basically translate English into ASL
    * [ASL Translator](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/asl-translator/id421784745?mt=8)
    * ASL Dictionary HD American Sign Language 
    * [ASL Dictionary American Sign Language](http://www.asl-dictionary.com/)

  - Translator from  ASL to words or sentence
    * There is a device that is under development by Texas A&M University(not a product yet). They said it's wearable but actually still not as wearable as it's described. And it's a device, users need extra investment on it. Below is the image of what this device looks like. Our product do not require any extra device but only your daily using cell phone.

    * No other related software can be found in the market right now.
