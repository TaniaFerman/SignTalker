#### Purpose: Research on existing ASL educational tools, tool designs, and mockups

#### Description: 

Existing language educational tools:

- Duolingo: This mobile tool has a good architecture design and we specifically like the pick your goal section.
- Memrise: We believe that this mobile application is one of the best educational tools. It has a great UI design, that is effective and entertaining at the same time. Memrise allow data gathering by having users' accounts. When the application has been downloaded, there is a quick tutorial to explain how to use it to new users. By using Memrise, users can learn while they interact with the quiz. The application will show the word and its translation, then a test will be displayed. 

Existing ASL educational tools:

- ASL Alphabet: This mobile app has a bad UI design. Besides, it shows different language like Chinese in the same screen making it confusing for users. It also has pixelated images and a really bad selection of colors.
- ASL Fingerspelling alphabet:
- ASL Fingerspelling:
- SignLanguage Alphabet Flashcards:
- Alphabet LIS 3D:
- Sign Language Keyboard:
- Hand Sign Language:
- ASL Alpha:
