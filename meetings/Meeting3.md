#### Description: Updating the project idea (better description and more research)

1. Niche:
  <br>
  For many kids, traditional education is neither relevant or boring. Educational videogames on the other hand, have earned the fame of being poorly constructed and boring. This is a topic that has been discussed, and users tend to repeat themselves: They fail to be fun because they forget the “game” part and insist too much on being “educational”. In turn, developers are stuck between the difficulties of creating a “videogame” (which is a hard project) with an educational theme that is fun without violence.

  Only in recent years, have developers realized their mistakes and started to design educational videogames that are fun as a rule. Although successful apps are still exotic, there are already a few examples that have created real companies and revenue. Successful examples have a few things in common: high quality, original approach, user generated content and strong gamification.

  Existent solutions also tend to prioritize solo learning over social experience. From the gamification personality types theory, we believe this is leaves out an important number of potential users out, thus creating a niche for an application that focuses social interaction. On the social side of personality, gamification examples like SongPop (100M users) show us that “knowledge games” without a strong artistic component can be successful if they provide a fun, interactive social experience.

  We believe that combining “education”, “gamification” and “user interaction” can inspire successful products in a non-crowded niche.

2. Project idea:
  <br>
  A quizzes app with a strong gamification component that focuses on user interaction and social engagement. The experience we want to create is that of groups of children being able to quickly set-up a multiplayer contest with their smartphones, where they answer multiple-choice questions to obtain advantages in a gamified theme with (simulated) real-time interactivity. Some key features are:
    - __Real-time interactivity:__ Users are able to challenge others, by quickly setting up multiplayer contests where they compete in real time to reach a goal. The success or failure in answering questions affect all players.
    - __Fun through interaction:__ Our main sell point is achieving fun through user interaction. We will design reusable game mechanics that award (or steal) advantages for good answers.
    - __Community driven:__ Friend lists, in-app chat and other elements that facilitate user interaction.
    - __Strong gamification elements:__ Scores, Leader boards, Badges, Levels, and other components that have been employed by successful competitors.
    - __Game-like theme:__ Our experience will have the appearance of a game (although it isn’t). The game sets the goal for the users (ex.: a small version of the “Ladders” board game where you can win or steal dice by answering questions at certain moments). We pretend this simple “game theme” to be interchangeable in the future through downloadable content.
    - __User generated content:__ Quiz topics and questions will be generated by users in an open website.

3. Target audience:
  <br>
  Statistics show that children get smartphones between the ages of 10 and 12 (age going down with time) while school leaving age ranges between 16 and 18 average (Canada and the US). Our main target is in the middle of this range, and we have multiple ways to get relevant user testing data.

4. What makes our idea different (and not easy to replicate):
  <br>    
  - __Design difficulty:__ As past failures have shown, gamification and user experience are not easy to successfully design and apply in an educational environment.
  - __Technical difficulty:__ This product requires building a system in multiple technologies: multiplayer backend server that handles concurrency, mobile app and (non-trivial) content website.
  - __Knowledge barrier:__ Both the niche and the concepts applied to the product design require a theoretical background on gamification and related topics.

5. How to turn this into a business:
  <br>
  We plan to follow similar rules to other successful competing products, adding some of our original ideas. Some of them are:
  - __In-app purchases:__ In the future, we plan to provide different “game themes” as paid downloadable content, aimed at particular experiences (2 player, multiplayer, team battle, solo learning, etc).
  - __Professionally created content:__ Sets of popular quizzes and quality material reviewed by educational professionals with graduate degrees, targeting strong user interests.
  - __Advertisement:__ A smart use of advertisements that doesn’t make them intrusive to our experience, if we are sure to have a big enough community.

#### Outcome: Getting a stronger idea for Game2study
