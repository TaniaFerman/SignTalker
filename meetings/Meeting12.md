#### Purpose: Status Update and Decision-making Meeting

#### Description: 

Due to the feedback that Ms Susanne Harnden gave us, we pivot to an Educational tool. We have learned from early feedback that positioning the phone on a flat surface and performing signs above it will be very unnatural for the majority of deaf users. Due to this, we have decided to pivot to an Educational tool. Creating an ASL translator that needs to face the user is extremely hard due to the inconsistent image backgrounds, resulting in a significant increase in the complexity of the algorithm. However, creating an ASL education tool will reduce the complexity of the algorithm, and we can focus on solving the background issues stemming from the new vertical mobile phone position.

#### Outcome: Pivot our idea to an ASL educational tool.
