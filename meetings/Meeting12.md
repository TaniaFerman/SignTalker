  __Location:__ Computer Vision Research Lab - EOW 353  

#### Purpose: Status Update and Decision-making Meeting

#### Description: 

Due to the feedback that Ms Susanne Harnden gave us, we pivot to an Educational tool. Creating an ASL translator that need to face the user is extremely hard, due to the different backgrounds, and moreover, because this new mobile phone position significantly increases the complexity of the algorithm. However, creating an ASL education tool will reduce the complexity of the algorithm, and we can focus on solving the background issues due to the new vertical mobile phone position.
  
#### Outcome: Pivoting our idea to an ASL educational tool.
