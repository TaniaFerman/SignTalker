  __Ending time:__ 14:30
  __Location:__ Island Deaf + Hard of Hearing Center 

#### Purpose: SignTalker's users
#### Description: 

Meeting with Susanne Harnden, Community Outreach Worker of IDHHC.

Ms Harnden gave us our first feedback about our tool. Our original idea for the SignTalker was to have the mobile phone on the surface of a table, in a horizontal position. However, Ms Harden told us that the position of the phone should be in front of the user, in a vertical way. She informed us that the American Sign Language should always be in vertical position facing the person in which you are speaking. Otherwise, the signs will be not accurate nor natural.

Ms Harnden agreed in becoming our first user, and continuing to give us feedback. She also agreed in helping us to find more ASL users.

#### Outcome: Our first ASL user! :tada:
